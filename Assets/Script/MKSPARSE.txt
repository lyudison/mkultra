<size=30>Report on Project MKSPARSE</size>

Genetic testing of MKFOOBAR provides evidence in support of the Quatermass hypothesis.  Molecular clock data places the manipulation during the Quaternary Period, most likely the early Holoscene.  Initial testing confirms applications to Project Zarathustra and MKTRANSCEND.  Selective disclosure to authorized industry partners will be conducted through MKHARVEST.
